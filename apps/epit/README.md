# Enhanced Periodic Interrupt Timer driver for KZM/SabreLite

This application demonstrates the use of CAmkES interrupt connector to receive hardware
interrupts. Change the hardware memory address and interrupt number in file `epit.camkes`
if you have a different hardware setup. The timer rate may vary depending on the input
clock frequency of the hardware.
